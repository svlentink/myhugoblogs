When thinking about data security,
we have a large multiple dimensional space of levels.
On one edge, having no clue and the other extreme having
everything organized to the point that if you die,
everything is accessible to your heirs.

## Attack surface

Before you can think about how to secure your data,
know how secure you want to be.

We all want to protect our data from malicious parties.
For some these are criminals and for others these include
(foreign) government agencies.

In the past I've worked at a party which handled more than
100k email boxes.
This made me aware of countries that have the right
to force you to unlock your phone/laptop at a border.
My work laptop contained access keys to email boxes of journalists etc.
which made me a potential target.

Nowadays I use a chromebook,
which has no data on it
(I reset/powerwash it before crossing a border).
Password managers usually synchronize via the cloud,
which I do not trust,
therefor I use a
[password generator app/chrome-extension](https://lent.ink/projects/pwd/),
which works in a different way.

## raw notes

The following levels are not from any source,
but could give an indication:

+ 00. No clue
+ 10. Know what type of data you have
+ 20. Clear overview of what data you have and where it resides
+ 30. All important data has a backup
+ 40. Every device (e.g. laptop, phone) can be stolen without losing any data
+ 50. Every device can be stolen without data being stolen (auto lock screen, disk encryption)

- Do you have an overview of all your (online) accounts?
- Do you have access to all accounts?
- If you die, do others have access to your accounts?
- Is your data backed up if you lose your phone now?
- Is your data backed up if you lose your laptop now?
- Do you wipe your laptop before crossing a border?
- Do you wipe your phone before crossing a border?
- Is your data backed up if your house burns down?
- Is your data backed up if an HEMP destroys electronics on a continent?
- Does your phone shows a lock screen when the screen goes on?
- Does your laptop locks itself after a short time (max 5min.)?
- Is full disk encryption enabled on your phone?
- Is full disk encryption enabled on your laptop?
