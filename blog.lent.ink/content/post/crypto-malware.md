Crypto lockers and other malware are an increasing problem
for companies (with Windows).
If you didn't had a proper data backup strategy,
it could bring the company to a halt,
making paying often the cheapest solution.


But how to put this on your balance,
what does finance need to know?

NOTE: do not take finance/tax advice from me!

In the following cases,
the expenses could be booked as 'Security'.

+ Let a test environment be infected to have completed the steps before
+ Having money in cryptocurrencies, allowing for fast transfer of it
+ Buying malware of the dark web to learn the weapons of your enemy
+ Perform a crypto unlock for a client who wants to stay anonymous (you are hired as 'security consultant')

Security expenses are both for pro-active (training, preparation)
as are for reactive,
when buying your way out could be the cheapest solution.
