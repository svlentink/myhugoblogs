closing with an example of technology opportunities.

Knowledge and technology can be used to serve or suppress humanity.
As humans we are able to use our cognitive ability to have discussions based on facts,
finding common grounds,
ways to unite with each other.

When people do not operate in the heighest level of
[Maslow's hierarchy](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html),
they will make
[suboptimal decisions](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/science-choice/201504/the-scarcity-mindset).
Short term focus is common in politics,
since project that will span 10 years won't get you re-elected in the next round.

who do have a

Those securing their own traffic will in some countries
"[automatically face imprisonment](https://gulfnews.com/uae/crime/using-vpns-what-uae-residents-need-to-know-1.1872123)".
