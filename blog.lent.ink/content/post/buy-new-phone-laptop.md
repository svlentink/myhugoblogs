This post details the hardware choices I make.
For me, fungibility is an important aspect.
I take pride in [backing up my data](https://blog.lent.ink/post/databackup/)
and be able to
[wipe my phone and laptop](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/digital-searches-at-border/20781/)
everytime I
[cross a border](https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017)
of a country that wants to make a
[backup](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2018/12/13/border-agents-are-copying-travelers-data-leaving-it-on-usb-drives/)
of my data.
This way of working pushes me in the cloud and less on local devices,
which in turn can be cheaper and more efficient (thus better battery life).

## Phone

When it comes to phones,
you have three options;

- A non smartphone (i.e. phone without apps for it)
- Android
- iOS (Apple iPhone)

Let's go over these three categories.

#### Non smartphone

The only people I encountered using them are
elderly people or cyber security professionals (going abroad: burner phone).
My professor for the course of
[Offensive Technologies](https://www.os3.nl/2017-2018/courses/ot/start) used one in 2018.

#### iPhone

People buy a Rolex as a status symbol,
it has the same features/qualities as much cheaper watches,
but it has style, brand image, looks good and better service.
This applies a bit to an iPhone.

Android phones have become really good
but you need to know which to buy.

#### Android

When it comes to Android, purist will say you have two options:
the 'clean' Android
and the ones with bloatware/[spyware](https://thehackernews.com/2017/05/hp-audio-driver-laptop-keylogger.html)
and usually a
[skin](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/worst-android-skin-3544019).
Skins feel a bit like 'pimped cars',
some folks like them,
but I'm more of an off the shelf vehicle type of guy.

For me, the duplicate apps and skins aren't the
[biggest issue](https://www.cnet.com/news/android-malware-that-comes-preinstalled-are-a-massive-threat/),
but the lack of (security) updates.

My current demands for a phone:

- MUST HAVE
  - [Android One](https://android.com/one) (clean Android with security updates), or a Google Pixel
  - min. 6GB RAM
  - min. 64GB storage
  - not too big, should fit in my hand and pocket (max width 73mm)
  - NFC for mobile payments
  - eSIM support (when device is lost, thieves cannot use your physical card to call payed numbers)
  - USB C
- SOULD HAVE
  - no more than full HD screen, more pixels (4k) is less battery life
  - more than 3000mAh battery
  - (back mounted) fingerprint reader

UPDATE q1 2023; my OnePlus phone has no ability to disable Pocket Mode anymore,
but this feature makes my phone unusable in arm strap (while running) or on motorcycle.


## Laptop

I've
[discussed using a Chromebook](https://blog.lent.ink/post/chromebook/)
before,
which I still recommend.
I do have an old Linux laptop to do the things that I don't attempt on a Chromebook,
like TFTP to a router or RS232 to a switch.

My requirements for a Chromebook:

- fanless (no humming sound)
- min. 4GB ram (8GB if using some kind of remote desktop)
- min. 32GB storage
- 64bit processor: that enables the build in Linux mode
- 13 or 14 inch **matte** screen, full HD, **IPS**
  - No 4k; shortens battery life
  - touch screen if you occasionally sign documents
- dark screen bezel and keyboard area (my Elitebook had a silver like finish, forcing me into dark areas)
- keyboard backlight


## Headset

### Bone conduction

I've used;
- Shokz OpenMove (75eu)
  - Easy to wash
  - USB-C
  - only 6h (not full day use)
  - lowest output volume of the 3 (not loud enough)
- Shokz OpenRun Pro (165eu)
  - Washing makes speakers sound muffled, very annoying
  - no USB-C
  - Poor quality when combining with ear plugs (Radians CEP002-T or Insta-Mold Solid Earplugs)
  - 10h battery life
- Blitzwolf BW-BTS8 (25eu)
  - Easy to wash
  - no USB-C
  - less comfortable than Shokz OpenRun
  - 10h battery life
  - Mic is unusable for phone calls

In case you want to buy the
[Shokz OpenRun](https://www.rtings.com/headphones/tools/compare/shokz-openrun-pro-bone-conduction-vs-shokz-openrun-bone-conduction/31212/31341?usage=19&threshold=0.10),
buy the OpenRun and **not** the OpenRun Pro,
since the speakers make it not true bone conducting,
resulting in issues with water or earplugs.


### Closed back overear

I've used
[Corsair Virtuose RGB Wireless XT](https://www.rtings.com/headphones/tools/compare/corsair-virtuoso-rgb-wireless-xt-vs-razer-blackshark-v2-hyperspeed-wireless/25347/44397?usage=19&threshold=0.10),
which was has a too short range to walk around the house and falls of my head too easily (also too expensive).
Used it for more than a year,
but switched to bone conduction headset because the Corsair is just too uncomfortable.

Also tried the JBL Quantom 810 wireless, which requires drivers to be installed for the USB dongle
instead of it being a generic USB audio interface.
So I literally wasn't able to use the USB dongle without buying a device with different OS,
so I sent it back within a day.

Currently I used the Razer BlackShark V2 HyperSpeed,
which seals off better than the Corsair,
is lighter,
stays on my head,
has a bigger range (so can walk through the house),
better battery life,
however the Corsair does have an indicator on the mic to show it's muted
(while on the Razer you feel with your finger if the button pressed inward).
The mic with it's cover is better on the razer,
but without the big sponge,
the Corsair is slightly better.
For a new one, I would go for the
[Razer BlackShark V2 Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_xjpBYwm5g).

I was also curious about the
[EPOS Sennheiser H3PRO Hybrid](https://nl.pepper.com/aanbiedingen/epos-sennheiser-h3pro-hybrid-gaming-headset-299592),
because it has ANC and detachable mic,
but the reviews were not reassuring.

[My demands](https://www.rtings.com/headphones/tools/table/122857)
for a headphone are;
- USB dongle wireless (Windows 10 doesn't do bluetooth phone calls)
- 50m or more range
- Bluetooth
- Detachable mic.
- over ear
- closed back
- ANC
- USB-C
- 30h or more of playback time


## My (current) devices

With all laptops having IPS.

- 2020: Motorola one action (170eu)
- 2021: (returned) HP chromebook 14a (229eu); has a [design flaw](https://support.google.com/chromebook/thread/85957053?hl=en), which I encountered on the na0053nd and na0153nd (`CTRL+ALT+T`, `ping google.com`)
- 2021: Lenovo chromebook s345 touch screen 4GB (255eu)

- 2021: OnePlus Nord CE 5G (never OnePlus for me again, an update made this device unusable for me)
- 2023: Pixel 6a
- 2023: Shokz OpenRun Pro (don't buy this one, the non-pro is waterproof and thus better!)
- 2023: new Chromebook on the shelf, haven't used yet
