This post details the hardware choices I make.
For me, fungibility is an important aspect.
I take pride in [backing up my data](https://blog.lent.ink/post/databackup/)
and be able to
[wipe my phone and laptop](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/digital-searches-at-border/20781/)
everytime I
[cross a border](https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017)
of a country that wants to make a
[backup](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2018/12/13/border-agents-are-copying-travelers-data-leaving-it-on-usb-drives/)
of my data.
This way of working pushes me in the cloud and less on local devices,
which in turn can be cheaper and more efficient (thus better battery life).

## Phone

When it comes to phones,
you have three options;

- A non smartphone (i.e. phone without apps for it)
- Android
- iOS (Apple iPhone)

Let's go over these three categories.

#### Non smartphone

The only people I encountered using them are
elderly people or cyber security professionals (going abroad: burner phone).
My professor for the course of
[Offensive Technologies](https://www.os3.nl/2017-2018/courses/ot/start) used one in 2018.

#### iPhone

People buy a Rolex as a status symbol,
it has the same features/qualities as much cheaper watches,
but it has style, brand image, looks good and better service.
This applies a bit to an iPhone.

Android phones have become really good
but you need to know which to buy.

#### Android

When it comes to Android, purist will say you have two options:
the 'clean' Android
and the ones with bloatware/[spyware](https://thehackernews.com/2017/05/hp-audio-driver-laptop-keylogger.html)
and usually a
[skin](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/worst-android-skin-3544019).
Skins feel a bit like 'pimped cars',
some folks like them,
but I'm more of an off the shelf vehicle type of guy.

For me, the duplicate apps and skins aren't the
[biggest issue](https://www.cnet.com/news/android-malware-that-comes-preinstalled-are-a-massive-threat/),
but the lack of (security) updates.

My current demands for a phone:

- MUST HAVE
  - [Android One](https://android.com/one) (clean Android with security updates)
  - min. 4GB RAM
  - min. 64GB storage
  - fingerprint reader
  - not too big, should fit in my hand and pocket
- WOULD HAVE
  - USB C (convenience)
  - no more than full HD screen, more pixels (4k) is less battery life
  - more than 3000mAh battery
  - NFC for mobile payments

For me there are currently two
[good options](https://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=9769&idPhone2=9739),
of which I would likely buy the *Motorola one action*,
which has a better fingerprint reader and has NFC for mobile payments
(the Xiaomi has better battery life and camera).


## Laptop

I've
[discussed using a Chromebook](https://blog.lent.ink/post/chromebook/)
before,
which I still recommend.
I do have an old Linux laptop to do the things that I don't attempt on a Chromebook,
like TFTP to a router or RS232 to a switch.

My requirements for a Chromebook:

- min. 4GB ram
- min. 32GB storage
- 64bit processor: that enables the build in Linux mode
- matte or touch screen, no glossy screen without touch!
  - matte screen for outdoor usage
  - touch screens scratch less/harder finish
- 13 or 14 inch, full HD, good quality (IPS)
  - No 4k; limits battery life
