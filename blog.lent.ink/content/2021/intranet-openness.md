During my carreer I've seen the inside of a few large corporates.
One thing I've encountered again and again is the lack of openness
or accessibility of internal(ly developed) tools/knowledge/data.

This decreases the re-use of that already available capital (tools/data)
and leads to the duplication of this asset,
which in turn leads to a decrease in its financial liquitiy.

## Developer view

As a developer, the more lines of code (LoC) the more bugs and less maintainable
the product.
Ideally you want to only configure an existing tool
(preferable open source so you will stay the owner of your own data),
instead of developing something (again and again).
Buy instead of recreate, since its not the core business of the company.

##

way of having a build server with internet access.

## Try to open source as much of the internal software as possible.
