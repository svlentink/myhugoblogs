After searching for an easy and quick way to install a USB charger to my motorcycle,
I decided to connect it to the battery charger.

## Tamiya connector

My motorcycle came with a tamiya connector,
which is connected to the motor's battery via a fuse.
We can use this connector to connect our USB charger!

## Warning

My motorcycle came with the wrong wiring of the plus (square)
and minus, making my battery charger generate some smoke in the past.
So please verify that it is hooked up correctly!

Another thing to look out for is that you put the right metal connectors inside of the tamiya connector,
the battery charger I had was having it reversed from what I found on the motorcycle and pictures online.
Thus make sure that the larger connector has the pins in it and the smaller connector has the receiving parts in it.
(pins on both side will slide over each other when wiggling, but this isn't ideal)
