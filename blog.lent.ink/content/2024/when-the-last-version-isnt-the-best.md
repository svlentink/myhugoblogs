More and more product nowadays optimize for shininess over durability/usability.

Lately I've become aware I am recommending people around me to buy an older version of a product instead of the newer one.
Not for cost saving, but because the gadget is actually a better product (but less fancy).

Two example come to mind.
The Shokz 'OpenRun Pro' and 'OpenRun Pro 2' are both worse than the regular 'OpenRun'.
I've had the non-Pro and Pro versions, the Pro sounds better,
but the Pro's speakers get muffled when expose to water.
So forget about rinsing them with water after a workout or even sweating during a workout can make them render unusable.

Secondly, the Garmin Forerunner series has switched from an always on display to a display similar to your phone screen.
The Forerunner 255 had a battery life of 2weeks, the 265 now has 3 days of battery life.
