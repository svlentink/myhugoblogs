My Garmin Forerunner 245 has an odd problem.
Every Few

My Garmin forerunner 245 keeps getting unpaired every few weeks or so.
This really sucks since I kept my phone on silent and let all notifications pass through my watch.
Lately some social and business connections have been impacted due to my responsiveness being very much off because my watch wouldn't let me know it was unpaired and I just missed stuff.

Tried manually pairing my watch to my phone and then disabling the permission of nearby devices on this app, but this app doesn't allow that. This app wants BLUETOOTH_ADMIN rights and this is used for planned obsolescence to make people frustrated with their older watches. Hope this requirement is removed soon so we can pair outside of the app to disprove this hypothesis.


## Why they want Bluetooth Admin rights

This gives them more info in the type of customer I am,
letting them see that besides the watch,
3 upper price class bluetooth headsets are paired with the phone the watch is paired to.

They could also see I switched from one pixel phone to the next within a year,
indicating I am a customer that likes to update his gadgets.

So my hypothesis is;
They want me to upgrade my watch becasue there are 2 never versions of the forerunner line
(of which the 255 is a better watch and the 265 has a terrible screen/battery life)
and use planned obsolescence to make me too annoyed with my current watch.

However, instead of having an aversion against the watch,
I now hate the brand, that enables this planned obsolescence.


On 2024-10-07 my watch was unpaired again, within a week since the last time.
The final straw for me. Now manually paired it and disable the app from having access to nearby devices.
This makes the watch useless to me, but I'll see in a few months if the watch is still in my list of paired bluetooth devices,
if so, that is enough proof for me to never buy anything of Garmin ever again.


More and more product nowadays optimize for shininess over durability/usability.

Lately I've become aware I am recommending people around me to buy an older version of a product instead of the newer one.
Not for cost saving, but because the gadget is actually a better product (but less fancy).

Two example come to mind.
The Shokz 'OpenRun Pro' and 'OpenRun Pro 2' are both worse than the regular 'OpenRun'.
I've had the non-Pro and Pro versions, the Pro sounds better,
but the Pro's speakers get muffled when expose to water.
So forget about rinsing them with water after a workout or even sweating during a workout can make them render unusable.

Secondly, the Garmin Forerunner series has switched from an always on display to a display similar to your phone screen.
The Forerunner 255 had a battery life of 2weeks, the 265 now has 3 days of battery life.


## Disclaimer

They gave themselves the option for planned obsolescence.
The fact that they require these elevated privileges is the problem.

I cannot confirm or deny they are actively depairing my phone.
It could be other software on my phone.
However, they have a motive, there is a smoking gun, and a body.

## Alternative

After looking at other eink smartwatches I settled on
the Coros Pace 3.
However, this app also requires the same Bluetooth Admin rights..,
hopefully this brand won't abuse this power.
