On my journey of self improvement I decided to get braces to straigthen out my tooth a bit.
Good idea, the company I chose, terrible choice.

## Payment to Dr Smile

It all started out with the payment,
which I did directly somewhere in december.
Then in January I received a payment reminder.
After some email exchange the burden of proven I payed was on me otherwise I would
need to deal with debt collector at my door.

After many email exchanges I received;

> We have already contacted our financial partner CareCapital so that they can recognise the payment made, and when they have done so they will send you a confirmation SMS to your mobile phone.

Showing that there are multiple companies and customer service doesn't represent one company
but it exposes you to the subcontractor dealings of their organization.

## Picking up whiting package

Around the end of my treatment,
I could collect my whitening treatment.
This was odd, why don't they just send it to you?
Turned out they do Xray and an explanation too,
which was not indicated, again very annoying!

Also, this pickup was at a different clinic,
but my initial clinic was not associated with DrSmile anymore.
Strange, dental clinics decide that doing business with this party is not worth it anymore?

## End of treatment; results not achieved

Around the treatment, it was clear it hadn't worked.
The last few aligners didn't fit my teeth and it was not doing a lot.
So I needed to get back to do a rescan for my new aligners.

Suddenly I got presented with a bill of 300eu again (relating to only the bottom aligner).
I hadn't uploaded my pictures and it was my fault I wasn't covered by warrenty.

> Your refinement plan has an additional cost of â‚¬299 for not complying with the guarantee requirement of uploading a photo to the DR SMILE app at each aligner change. 
> As indicated in the treatment welcome email, in the event of any error or fault with the app, the photo must be sent immediately to our patient care email address so that it is recorded in your file and complies with the treatment guarantee.

Going back through the initial email I read;
> for each aligner you will take a photo (everything is very well specified in your patient portal on the web and APP) and by fulfilling all of this, you will have a results guarantee, where if we don't achieve the result from the simulation, we will cover the costs of any necessary refinements (additional aligners) until we obtain the promised result!

Pay attention to the part:
> everything is very well specified in your patient portal on the web and APP

Half of the time photo upload failed in the app and then it didn't notify me about the need of sending an email
and the app sometimes asked for a photo and sometimes not.

After calling them,
they told me that the initial email (in English) was send out by sales
and that the final terms were communicated later in another email (in Portuguese)
where they did outline that you needed to send an email in case of app failure.

Again the same problem,
the problem was on my side,
the customer is again there to defend their own position,
the same as with the initial payment.

## No results, no retainer

In the end, I am not feeling like giving this horrible company more money,
so I didn't take their bait and cut my losses.
I also paid for a retainer, but since the job isn't finished,
I don't want it on my unfinished result.

## Lessons

Friends of mine used Impress aligners and were happy with them,
also they had more checkups.
I thought this would be a downside,
but sending out 14 aligners at once and then the last half doesn't fit
properly is worse.

Also I would recommend anyone to not buy the retainer with your package
since any local dentist can do that.
In my case I paid for it and got nothing.

## Conclusion

DrSmile is a web of multiple organizations,
they deliver a horrible service.
Their app doesn't work,
which is a feature,
since you are unable to upload pictures,
you won't have a guarantee and thus will need to pay more.
This is a
[scam](https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/15vftyz/dr_smile_scam/)
and they have multiple companies
to guard themselves.
