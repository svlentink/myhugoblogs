First let's clarify, this guide is NOT meant for junior/starting/trainee developers.

The intented reader is an IT professional wanting to transition into being a freelancer.
Which will provide more freedom (to move abroad) and ability to buy tax deductable
(e.g. development toys/gear).


## 01 Registering company

1. Company name & domain name
2. List of activities, denoted in [SBI](https://www.kvk.nl/overzicht-standaard-bedrijfsindeling/) codes
3. [KVK](https://www.kvk.nl/inschrijven-en-wijzigen/inschrijven/)

## 02 Setting up company

- slick [resume](https://lentink.consulting/#resume)
- get a bank account on the name of your company (not on your personal name) since some companies demand this
  - The [free business account of Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/business/business-account) allows registering on company name and comes with a Visa card
  - The [free business account of N26](https://n26.com/en-eu/free-business-bank-account) is on personal name and comes with a Maestro card
- beroeps & bedrijfsaansprakelijkheids verzekering (I have it from Markel via a [broker](https://www.henst-lunsen.nl))
- check [other](https://www.kvk.nl/advies-en-informatie/bedrijf-runnen/checklist-aan-de-slag/) sources as well


### Not needed

- [Bookkeeping system](https://www.e-boekhouden.nl/prijzen), don't waste time on this when starting, this comes after you've landed your first gig
- Invoice template, since this might be done for you by your broker (e.g. Brainnet)
- Website, focus on a good resume/linkedin instead, but do register your domain name


## 03 Getting hired

### Recruiters

Recruiters add value in some cases,
but in my case they usually are a MITM.
Examples when a recuiter might add value work;

- First freelance assignment and are socially awkward
- you're scarce (e.g. specific skills like Cobol)
- you're hard to sell
- you're introverted
- you're not a self starter (please stop reading, don't be an entrepreneur)
- you're too lazy to make a slick [resume](https://lentink.consulting/#resume)

Why I prefer to find an assignment on an online platform;

- I don't want a recruiter to change my resume when sending it out
- I don't like recruiters emailing/calling me constantly; I prefer pull vs. push messages
- The 10-20% cut they take, I prefer to receive
- Recruiters lied (gave incorrect info) to me in multiple occasions (sellers just want to sell)
- When I apply, I feel more in control
- Direct communications, not via (an extra) intermediate


### Vacancy brokers

I've only used Brainnet and Headfirst up until now,
so I cannot comment on the others.

- brainnet (2.5eu overhead per worked hour)
- headfirst (3eu overhead per worked hour)
- itstaffings
- harvey nash
- yacht
