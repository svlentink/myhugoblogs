While being a decent headphone,
the touch control on the right ear cup cannot be disabled.
This 'feature' or bug should be able to be disabled via the app
since it is activated constantly when wearing it around my neck.

Luckily it only takes 2 minutes and a screw driver to disable this bug.

- The outer cap can be taken off by putting your nails under the edge and pulling it
- Then we unscrew 4 screws
- Get the speaker off
- Poke the cable named touch, making it disconnect/broken
