For private reasons I needed to have a bank account in Portugal,
which needed to be opened a week before I arrived in the country
(to allow funds from another EU bank account to have time to arrive on the new account).

## Situation

1. I have a NIF
2. Didn't bother to open a PT bank account the last times I was in Portugal (a bit dumb).
3. Registered in another EU country as a citz. and thus not have a PT citz. card
4. don't care about initial deposit amount, that's the whole goal anyways

My situation is a follows; I want to open a PT bank account online, then transfer funds onto it and buy my new house in PT through writing a cheque (I'll arrive in PT next week). Thus I first thougth of opening the Basic account, buy the house with it, register myself as a resident on that address and when I'm located in PT and can accept mail their, upgrade to the plus account.


Normally I never care about branches,
but since I needed to write a cheque,
I wanted a bank with lots of branches,
thus leaving
Credito Agricola, Novo Banko, EuroBic.

CA was impossible due to requiring [CMD](https://www.autenticacao.gov.pt/a-chave-movel-digital)
(which requires a PT phone number and then password send to home address).

During
[account creation](https://apps.eurobic.pt/Login_eUI/RegisterMC.aspx)
EuroBic didn't accept my NIF

NovoBanco requires has 2 processes to open an account, the CMD or another process, which requires a PT phone number.
Thus Novo Banco is off the table too.

With Santander, if you do not go for the CMD option, but the video call,
it states that you need to be born PT.



How I normally would make my decision for a bank;
1. is the bank free or does it offer health care that outways the costs
2. transfer fees
3. proper digital environment/app
4. English website?



Hi, I'm living in the Netherlands and am buying a house in Matosinhos on 15th of July. To transfer the money, I need to have a Portuguese bank account to transfer the money using a cheque. Can I, while I do not yet live in Portugal, open an account remotely. I have a NIF.


To create a 
1. bank account online, they want to have a
2. chave-movel-digital (CMD), to create a CMD you need to login with
3. NIF + access code, to get the access code for you NIF, you need to fill out a form, for which you need a
4. Portuguese phone number, which, when you want to have a sim
