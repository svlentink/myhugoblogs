forget about Tranquilidade insurance,
they don't pay back if you sell your car but give a bank cheque, which likely requires you to open a new bank account that still accepts them.
Only allow portugues phone numbers; https://webhub.tranquilidade.pt/#/auth/signup
Doesn't allow for foreign IBAN numbers, just a very old expensive mess. Cheques, phonenumber and bank problems. (Dec 2024)

stopped by police in Faro for having city lights on, on motorcycle, needed to have regular lights on.
Stopped by police near Porto for having wood sticking out of my car,
but luckily my portugues was good enough to recognize "autostrada" and I could explain I was driving a maximum of 30
and explained the route that avoided the highway. Didn't had ID or driverslicense on me and still hadn't converted my Dutch license to a Portugues one after 2.5 years.

Best portuguese pilsner; Super BOck (Porto)
Best portuguese Guinness; Sagres Preta (Lisboa)
caipirinha
vinho do porto (do a wine tasting in Vila nova de Gaia)

Transfer via MBway usually works by using a phone number,
but Activobank requires you to upload your full contact list to use this feature..
In my case, I installed activobank in my private space on android, which has a Google account without contacts in its contact list.
