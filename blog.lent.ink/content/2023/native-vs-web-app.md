If is service should be available on the web,
then creating a web app is easier than developing for all mobile platforms.
Personally I was always an advocate for HTML5 web apps.

However, the customer is always right and the customer experience is the most important.
Personally I had installing an app for everything and use web apps as much as possible,
also since they reduce the footprint on my mobile device and have less permissions to my device/data.

But after helping a boomer checking in for a flight I saw the issue with using web apps.
The boomer had 3 ways he manipulated the website, resulting in it not working.

1. Google translate; changes content of page
2. Ublock/Adblock; changes content of page
3. Google Chrome autofill form (when email suggested, he clicked on it); this can fill in fields that are hidden with values that are not expected.

After seeing this happening I understood why all companies need apps,
browsers cannot be trusted.
