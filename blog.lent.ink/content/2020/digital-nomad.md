Renting a place per week or per month?

Advantages of renting per month:
- cheaper
- more easy to make friends if people know you'll be around
- no checkout, checkin in your weekend

Advantages of per week:
- less cleaning, fresh made bed every week
- if a place sucks
- see more places
- more flexible
- new environment (helps me work better)

Rental places may suck in lots of ways,
unexpected noise,
no proper hot shower,
flaky WiFi,
etc.
I once spend a few hours fixing the heater,
which the landlord thanked me for,
but was basically wasted time for me.

For me when traveling by public transport,
it is nice to sometimes spend two weeks somewhere,
to be able to rent a motorcycle in the weekend in the middle,
but when I have my own transportation (car/motorycle),
I prefer a weekly home rotate.


Other tips:
- if you plan on using the washing machine, let it run once before on the warmest to clean the machine (optionally with a dishwasher tablet in it)
- only wash half of your cloths each time, you are using an unknown washing machine
- skip cotton, pick more sportswear/synthetic clothing; dry much quicker, less weight, no wrinkles, resists stains, better durability, mold/mildew resistant.
- keep a list of what you change, if you also work in the room you forget that your desk lamp was actually the bed light and the missing cushion you used to fix the sagging mattress.
- remember that the large backpacks are for camping, you don't need stuff like cooking gear/towel/sleeping bag etc.
- one USB C laptop charger can charge both laptops and your phone, the USB of your laptop can then charge your other gear

Public transit/planes vs. car/motorcycle

Having your own vehicle is for sure more expensive and you meet less people along the way.
When you are with a backpack that is clearly larger than one going to work,
people are interested in where you are traveling to.
My stuff (including two 14inch laptops) fits in my relatively small North Face Borealis (perfect for hand luggage on plane),
but packing it with stuff strapped to the side/top makes packing easier and leades to more conversations.

Cheese, olives, raw tomatos and bell pepper.

Normally I'm eating out about 2 days per week,
for me getting a place with kitchen (to cook for the other 5 days)
is more expensive than renting a place without kitchen and do take/dining out more
and sometime grab a salade of the supermarket.


Someone working in a hostel a few hours per week to sleep and eat there for free,
or one looking like a surf dude, traveling for months, financed by working at local bars,
or a pensioner staying at a hostel for the winter months.
