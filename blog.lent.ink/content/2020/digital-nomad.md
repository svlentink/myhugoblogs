The 2020 lockdown has unlocked the possibility for numerous people
to become a digital nomad.
Usually the biggest hurdle is finding a location independent job.

In this post I'll share my toe dipping into this new lifestyle.
It's written for people who,
just like me,
are able to work from home now.

## Career development
We all know the typical nomads,
some example I encountered;
- the person living for free *room and board* at an hostel
- the guy with the surf dude look, working at local (beach) bars to pay for his wanderlust
- the person working and stay at an organic farm to find oneself again

While the approach works for those people,
my **priority is different**.
For me,
my career development and enjoying challenging jobs/assignments
is what I desire,
that I'm able to travel along that is a nice bonus.

Before starting this journey,
I already payed attention to
[my schedule](#FIXME),
doing things that enhance my work productivity;
like physical exercise for mental releave
and
alternative diet for increased focus (intermittent fasting and low carb).

## Living standards
For some, the *van life* works.
Personally, I need stable WiFi,
a good night's rest
and
not worrying about
finding a shower or washing machine.

Many people recommend co-working spaces or working from a bar,
which is not an option anymore with lockdown measures,
and wouldn't fit my hours of meeting calls/pair-programming a day.
(pair-programming is done via screen sharing and audio calling)

Thus the shared room/hostel isn't the place for me,
since my work productivity can only be guaranteed with
a private room or apartment.

#### Renting arrangements
Since I usually work for fixed hours to match my colleagues at home,
I can't switch places during workdays,
since you usually need to check out before 11 and check in after 2 or 3.
Therefore, I only switch places in the weekend.

Renting a place per week or per month?

Advantages of renting per month:
- cheaper
- more easy to make friends if people know you'll be around
- no checkout, checkin in your weekend

Advantages of per week:
- less cleaning, fresh made bed every week
- if a place sucks
- see more places
- more flexible
- new environment (helps me work better)

Rental places may suck in lots of ways,
unexpected noise,
no proper hot shower,
flaky WiFi,
etc.
I once spend a few hours fixing the heater,
which the landlord thanked me for,
but was basically wasted time for me.

For me when traveling by public transport,
it is nice to sometimes spend two weeks somewhere,
to be able to rent a motorcycle in the weekend in the middle,
but when I have my own transportation (car/motorycle),
I prefer a weekly home rotate.


## Prerequisites
We assume you've ticked the following boxes;
- know what [data is valuable](https://blog.lent.ink/post/databackup/) on your devices and do regular backups of it (to the cloud)
- know what data is visible (e.g. DNS and SNI) to entities having access to the same (WiFi) network and secure what needs to be secured
or that you have a company laptop that has managed this for you ;)


Other tips:
- if you plan on using the washing machine, let it run once before on the warmest to clean the machine (with dishwasher detergent in it)
- only wash half of your cloths each time, you are using an unknown washing machine
- skip cotton, pick more sportswear/synthetic clothing; dry much quicker, less weight, no wrinkles, resists stains, better durability, mold/mildew resistant.
- keep a list of what you change, if you also work in the room you forget that your desk lamp was actually the bed light and the missing cushion you used to fix the sagging mattress.
- remember that the large backpacks are for camping, you don't need stuff like cooking gear/towel/sleeping bag etc.
- one USB C laptop charger can charge both laptops and your phone, the USB of your laptop can then charge your other gear

## Mode of transportation
In these lockdown times, research your options
since they might change each week.
Usually road travel is less restricted than
public transit/planes.

#### Travel cost
For me, my first destination was a 2500km ride from my house,
which costed me 150eu for a round trip (airplane) from Amsterdam
and I met a fellow Dutch, who paid 30eu for a round trip from Eindhoven.
Driving would have costed me over 500eu on fuel for a round trip.

Public transit/planes vs. car/motorcycle

Having your own vehicle is for sure more expensive and you meet less people along the way.
When you are with a backpack that is clearly larger than one going to work,
people are interested in where you are traveling to.
My stuff (including two 14inch laptops) fits in my relatively small North Face Borealis (perfect for hand luggage on plane),
but packing it with stuff strapped to the side/top makes packing easier and leades to more conversations.

Raw tomatos/bell pepper, can of tuna, bag of nuts, a brie etc. full fat coconut milk
Cheese, olives, raw tomatos and bell pepper.

Normally I'm eating out about 2 days per week,
for me getting a place with kitchen (to cook for the other 5 days)
is more expensive than renting a place without kitchen and do take/dining out more
and sometime grab a salade of the supermarket.


Someone working in a hostel a few hours per week to sleep and eat there for free,
or one looking like a surf dude, traveling for months, financed by working at local bars,
or a pensioner staying at a hostel for the winter months.


Being invite to a party at a student campus at 1am (2am work timezone).

## Afterthoughs

Most of my colleagues enjoy an occasional story of my wanderlust adventures,
however, don't overdo it and waste your privilege by making people envious.
Also have an internet backup through a MiFi or hotspot of your phone.
If your internet gets broken at home, people accept that,
but not if you are on your *workation*!

At the start I mentioned people working for *room and board*,
just like everyone I also *pay in kind* for things
(when eating at family I usually fix some computer or electricity).

be a travel vlogger/lifestyle blogger (entertainment industry,content creator), not a travel photographer, since you are not competing with local jobs, thus no work permit

Ofcourse it would be awesome to
[drive from Alaska to Argentina on a motorcycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud18v-5vrSw)
or some
[other adventure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmmXvoKGNGk),
but that would require me to monitize my videos better,
instead of doing the work I'm currently doing.

I generally prefer to run my workloads on the cloud/servers
instead of on my local laptop and connect no external monitors,
making me generally have no laptop issue when colleagues do have them.
At one company colleagues who asked for a powerful laptop
got a
Thinkpad P73 (3.4KG)
instead of the normal
T590 (1.75KG),
which is a significant difference for a digital nomad!
