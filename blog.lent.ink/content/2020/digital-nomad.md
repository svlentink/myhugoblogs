The 2020 lockdown has unlocked the possibility for numerous people
to become a digital nomad.
Usually the biggest hurdle is finding a
[location independent job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHhYtZV_T9M).

In this post I'll share my toe dipping into this new lifestyle.
It's written for people who,
just like me,
are able to work from home now.

## Career development
We all know the typical nomads,
some example I encountered;
- the person living for free *room and board* at an hostel
- the guy with the surf dude look, working at local (beach) bars to pay for his wanderlust
- the person working and stay at an organic farm to find oneself again

While the approach works for those people,
my **priority is different**.
For me,
my career development and enjoying challenging jobs/assignments
is what I desire,
that I'm able to travel along that is a nice bonus.

Before starting this journey,
I already payed attention to
[my schedule](#FIXME),
doing things that enhance my work productivity;
like physical exercise for mental releave
and
alternative diet for increased focus (intermittent fasting and low carb).

## Living standards
For some, the *van life* works.
Personally, I need stable WiFi,
a good night's rest
and
not worrying about
finding a shower or washing machine.

Many people recommend co-working spaces or working from a bar,
which is not an option anymore with lockdown measures,
and wouldn't fit my hours of meeting calls/pair-programming a day.
(pair-programming is done via screen sharing and audio calling)

Thus the shared room/hostel isn't the place for me,
since my work productivity can only be guaranteed with
a private room or apartment.

#### Renting arrangements
Since I usually work for fixed hours to match my colleagues at home,
I can't switch places during workdays,
since you usually need to check out before 11 and check in after 2 or 3.
Therefore, I only switch places in the weekend.

Renting a place per week or per month?

Advantages of renting per month:
- cheaper
- more easy to make friends if people know you'll be around
- no checkout, checkin in your weekend

Advantages of per week:
- less cleaning, fresh made bed every week
- if a place sucks
- see more places
- more flexible
- new environment (helps me work better)

Rental places may suck in lots of ways,
unexpected noise,
no proper hot shower,
flaky WiFi,
etc.
I once spend a few hours fixing the heater,
which the landlord thanked me for,
but was basically wasted time for me.

For me when traveling by public transport,
it is nice to sometimes spend two weeks somewhere,
to be able to rent a motorcycle in the weekend in the middle,
but when I have my own transportation (car/motorycle),
I prefer a weekly home rotate.


## Prerequisites
We assume you've ticked the following boxes;
- know what [data is valuable](https://blog.lent.ink/post/databackup/) on your devices and do regular backups of it (to the cloud)
- know what data is visible (e.g. DNS and SNI) to entities having access to the same (WiFi) network and secure what needs to be secured
or that you have a company laptop that has managed this for you ;)


Other tips:
- if you plan on using the washing machine, let it run once before on the warmest to clean the machine (with dishwasher detergent in it)
- only wash half of your cloths each time, you are using an unknown washing machine
- skip cotton, pick more sportswear/synthetic clothing; dry much quicker, less weight, no wrinkles, resists stains, better durability, mold/mildew resistant.
- keep a list of what you change, if you also work in the room you forget that your desk lamp was actually the bed light and the missing cushion you used to fix the sagging mattress.
- remember that the large backpacks are for camping, you don't need stuff like cooking gear/towel/sleeping bag etc.
- one USB C laptop charger can charge both laptops and your phone, the USB of your laptop can then charge your other gear

## Mode of transportation
In these lockdown times, research your options
since they might change each week.
Usually road travel is less restricted than
public transit/planes.

#### Travel cost
For me, my first destination was a 2500km ride from my house,
which costed me 150eu for a round trip (airplane) from Amsterdam
and I met a fellow Dutch, who paid 30eu for a round trip from Eindhoven.
Driving would have costed me over 500eu on fuel for a round trip.

Public transit/planes vs. car/motorcycle

Having your own vehicle is for sure more expensive and you meet less people along the way.
When you are with a backpack that is clearly larger than one going to work,
people are interested in where you are traveling to.
My stuff (including two 14inch laptops) fits in my relatively small North Face Borealis (perfect for hand luggage on plane),
but packing it with stuff strapped to the side/top makes packing easier and leades to more conversations.

Raw tomatos/bell pepper, can of tuna, bag of nuts, a brie etc. full fat coconut milk
Cheese, olives, raw tomatos and bell pepper.

Normally I'm eating out about 2 days per week,
for me getting a place with kitchen (to cook for the other 5 days)
is more expensive than renting a place without kitchen and do take/dining out more
and sometime grab a salade of the supermarket.


Someone working in a hostel a few hours per week to sleep and eat there for free,
or one looking like a surf dude, traveling for months, financed by working at local bars,
or a pensioner staying at a hostel for the winter months.

## Afterthoughs

Most of my colleagues enjoy an occasional story of my wanderlust adventures,
however, don't overdo it and waste your privilege by making people envious.
Also have an internet backup through a MiFi or hotspot of your phone.
If your internet gets broken at home, people accept that,
but not if you are on your *workation*!

At the start I mentioned people working for *room and board*,
just like everyone I also *pay in kind* for things
(when eating at family I usually fix some computer or electricity).

Ofcourse it would be awesome to
[drive from Alaska to Argentina on a motorcycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud18v-5vrSw)
or some
[other adventure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmmXvoKGNGk),
but that would require me to monitize my videos better,
instead of doing the work I'm currently doing.

I generally prefer to run my workloads on the cloud/servers
instead of on my local laptop and connect no external monitors,
making me generally have no laptop issue when colleagues do have them.
At one company colleagues who asked for a powerful laptop
got a
Thinkpad P73 (3.4KG)
instead of the normal
T590 (1.75KG),
which is a significant difference for a digital nomad!


Most governments still require you to have a physical address,
which is usually easiest find with a friend or family member.
But be aware that a
[welfare state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_state)
like the Netherlands may punish the resident.
E.g. if it is social housing,
the housing company gets an overview of all the annual incomes of all people at an address
and raises the rent when they collectively earn X amount (but it won't go down if you leave the address).
The government may decide to stop their welfare/staps/benefit.
Therefore only arrange an address of someone who is economically contributing to society.

[Putting your work out there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyVpRiqOvt4)
or
[writing it down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0vUsxhMczI)
is a good practice.

When checkout is around 10 and you plan to work during the day,
finding a place with a shared lobby/living room
that you can use saves booking double nights when traveling that day.


renting places is outsourcing managing home interior
and eliminating the need for cleaning (if you switch places weekly)

In portugal 95 is E5 and 98 E10, which is different from most other countries
(my older motorcycle needs the lowest percentage ethanol E5, 5%).

As a student, I would plan my holidays around meetups,
like having a workshop at a Google office or
learning interesting stuff about containers at a workshop at Snyk.
Now that I have a business,
these travels can be business expensive,
but it changed during Covid.

When countries were opening up again and air travel was still hard,
I figured I could also drive to a meeting where I would normally fly to.
However, this requires me to drive the whole weekend (for example to Madrid)
and stay there the whole week.
During this week I need an office space to do my consulting job.
Finding a private office space in a foreign city for just a week
and the need to stay there for a week, since driving will be in the weekend,
lead me to an airbnb with a desk to work on.

This lifestyle of staying in Airbnbs and traveling feel a bit like a digital nomad.
With the perk of being able to write off his temporary office space (airbnb)
and travel (driving) as business expensive,
as long as I sincerely go to interesting meetups/events/workshop to network and learn.

When renting a private office space (thus no shared office space) in a foreign country (language barrier) for a week,
the only feasible way of arranging this is via Airbnb or a similar provider.

And if you were to work
[6 days per week](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/six-days-shall-you-work/)
and want to have office space for it,
you will need to rent the night before (otherwise you can only start after 2pm)
and rent an extra night (otherwise you need to checkout before 10am).
Therefore, you will need to rent the room for 7 nights if you want to work for 6 days in it.

Before being a freelancer (as a student),
I would fly to TLV to join a workshop at the Google office
and enjoy the beach afterwards.
Or drive to a meetup/eventbrite of HackerX (networking event)
or a technical workshop.
Fuel and airplane tickets be paid by company.
Travel for 3 reasons:
- business meetings (arrangement buying and selling smarthome, import motorcycle from Spain)
- workshop/courses
- networking events


How to stay working from home

After brainstorming with colleagues who were also hired during the lockdown,
who weren't planning on going to the office when things were opening up,
I decided to put my findings on paper.

Basically we'll look on how to become the best remote employee a manager could think off,
that results you being so effective in working by yourself while keeping connected,
that being in the office together only leads to fun interactions, but not to more productive ones.


## Effective communication

When the world eased out of lockdown it became clear that managers wanted to go back to the office
and that most people executing the tasks did not want to.
Initially I thought it was due to us developers making something tangible;
at the end of the day the code works, the ticket is done,
while manager manage people, thus harder to grasp.

But what if we as professionals facilitate managers in managing us in digital ways?
We already found that Scrum/Kanban boards with items
(for which the developer create subtickets to reflect current task at hand)
works quite well.
Now we should also facilitate managers in having an easy time managing the task executing individuals.

The less we commute the more sustainable a company becomes,
this is especially relevant for companies that want to become carbon neutral.


new in company, write down all links, create own getting started/onboarding guide

Better than stickies, no hand writing issues, if everyone is tech-savvy,
thus everyone will figure it out in my field, otherwise they risk the are seen as non tech-savvy.
And then you cannot work from home in the first place..
Tools too complex? then you aren't tech-savvy and should not work at home in the first place.


Every subtask I work on has a link to the wiki page, shared document or git branch I am working on.

Ask yourself; what could a manager, stakeholder or anyone be interested in seeing,
being interested in being kept in the loop, updated upon?
From our side it needs to feel spammy, but they should get the feeling that they are unburdened.
If they ever reach out for an update, you are doing it wrong,
even if things go wrong, they should feel like they are always up to date, on top of it!

Face to face should not lead to more information,
just to more fun.
This will result in no business motivation to meet in person,
just for fun.

When sharing, use full HD, not a higher resolution.

%00km away from office, but refuses to wear headphones, causing an echo in meetings.
You cannot call on speaker phone since your microphone will pick up the conversation,
causing an echo. Thus ALWAYS wear a headset for (video) calls.
And always mute all the people who refuse to cause an echo and put in the chat:
"Just muted @personX for causing an echo. Can you please use a headphone instead of being on speaker?"
Please mute yourself while not speaking if not using a heaphone.
This might feel like naming and shaming,
but the goal of having a good experience in working from home/video conferencing is more important.

In one case a colleague lived 500km from the office and wanted to continue working from home,
but refused to wear headphones,
which made me privately bring the importance of using a headset to his attention,
contributing to the likelihood of continue working from home.

correlation between digital literacy in video calls and age, boomers that (feel they) are in charge tend to refuse or are not aware of using headphones.

when people work all in the office, the feel that they are more on the same page,
but that's due to social cohesion,
not actually on the subject matter.
Gaps in knowledge, alignment and clarity is becoming more aparent in remote working that in the office,
which actually increases productivity.

When taking longer off/on holiday,
offer to work for one or two hours
to keep up to date, be able to answer question,
but also to make sure you keep a healthy schedule (e.g. work from 9-10 every morning)

Retrospective, what went well:
More people having headphones, equals better video conferencing experience!

chain oiler
wind deflector (one central mount, not the one with two legs)
trottle lock?

allow people to use without headphones;
please mute your speakers (headphones can be still on) before unmuting your mic.
